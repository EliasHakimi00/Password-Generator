# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview
 
This week’s challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

This is the Week 5 password generator challenge. I think this challenge was helpful for getting me more used to Javascript, especially in relation to the queryselector method. This challenge took me quite a long time to get through becuase there were a lot of errors I kept making. For example, it took me a long time to realise that I should be parseInt for the prompt on line 93 to convert the string into a numerical value. I also thought that instead of having to store getPasswordOptions() in the options() variable, I could just call getPasswordOptions() by itself, eliminating the need for line 113, but I then realised that I needed it as I otherwise wouldn't be able to store properties of the returned object throughout the rest of the code. Overall, this challenge was quite helpful in further demonstrating the importance of storing returned values in variables, if statements, console.log, alerts and the queryselector.
